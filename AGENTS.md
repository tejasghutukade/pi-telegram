# Project Context

## 0. Meta-Protocol Principles

- `Constraint-Driven Evolution`: Add structure when the bridge gains real operator or runtime constraints
- `Single Source of Truth`: Keep durable rules in `AGENTS.md`, open work in `BACKLOG.md`, completed delivery in `CHANGELOG.md`, and deeper technical detail in `/docs`
- `Boundary Clarity`: Separate Telegram transport concerns, π integration concerns, rendering behavior, and release/documentation state
- `Progressive Enhancement + Graceful Degradation`: Prefer behavior that upgrades automatically when richer runtime context exists, but always preserves a useful fallback path when it does not
- `Runtime Safety`: Prefer queue and rendering behavior that fails predictably over clever behavior that can desynchronize the Telegram bridge from π session state
- `Mobile Companion Boundary`: `pi-telegram` extends a live Pi session for phone use; it is not a remote terminal, PTY supervisor, or process launcher. Do not add terminal-control tricks to make Telegram pretend to be the TUI.
- `Pi-Native Extensibility`: `pi-telegram` should inherit π's own extension philosophy. It is not only a Telegram adapter; it should become a small, convenient, composable Telegram shell for π extensions, where new capabilities plug into stable contracts instead of forking polling, transport, or menu ownership.

## 1. Concept

`pi-telegram` is a Telegram runtime adapter for π: a session-local operator console that turns a private Telegram DM into a runtime surface for prompt intake, streaming previews, queue management, model/thinking/settings controls, inbound/outbound handler pipelines, voice/buttons, artifacts, and extension callback interop. Treat it as a Telegram membrane around π, not a narrow message pipe.

The core product loop is mobile continuation: start or supervise work in the terminal, then continue from Telegram while away from the keyboard. Telegram controls should be a safe extension-facing subset of the live session, not a replacement for Pi's interactive TUI.

## 2. Identity & Naming Contract

- `Telegram turn`: One unit of Telegram input processed by π; this may represent one message or a coalesced media group
- `Queued Telegram turn`: A Telegram turn accepted by the bridge but not yet active in π
- `Active Telegram turn`: The Telegram turn currently bound to the running π agent loop
- `Preview`: The transient streamed response shown through Telegram drafts or editable messages before the final reply lands
- `Scoped models`: The subset of models exposed to Telegram model selection when π settings or CLI flags limit the available list

## 3. Project Topology

- `/index.ts`: Main extension entrypoint and runtime composition layer for the bridge
- `/api/*.ts`: Public package entrypoint membranes. Export only stable companion-extension symbols documented in `/docs/public-api.md`; keep runtime helpers in `/lib` package-private.
- `/lib/*.ts`: Flat domain modules for reusable runtime logic. Favor domain files such as queueing/runtime, replies, polling, updates, outbound-attachments, commands, lifecycle hooks, prompts, prompt-templates, pi SDK adapter/bindings, Telegram API, config, turns, media, setup, rendering, app menu, menu-model, menu-thinking, menu-queue, status/model-resolution support, and other cohesive bridge subsystems; use `shared` only when a type or constant truly spans multiple domains
- `/tests/*.test.ts`: Domain-mirrored regression suites that follow the same flat naming as `/lib` plus public package-boundary regressions for `/api`
- `/docs/README.md`: Documentation index for technical project docs
- `/docs/architecture.md`: Runtime and subsystem overview for the bridge
- `/docs/public-api.md`: Stable public API map for commands, config, assistant markup, extension APIs, package entrypoints, and compatibility boundaries
- `/README.md`: User-facing project entry point. Keep its rhythm as install → connect → use → core features → docs, with vivid examples that explain the runtime adapter/operator-console model without duplicating full docs.
- `/AGENTS.md`: Durable engineering and runtime conventions
- `/BACKLOG.md`: Canonical open work. Keep only open top-level tasks; when all subtasks under a top-level task are complete, remove that task from the backlog and record completed delivery in `CHANGELOG.md` if user-visible. Put detailed decomposition under the single owning top-level task with nested checkboxes and explicit done criteria instead of promoting completed slices into separate top-level backlog items.
- `/CHANGELOG.md`: Completed delivery history. Prefer multiple domain-scoped bullets in the form `[Domain]`: change + impact instead of accumulating unrelated changes into one long entry.

## 4. Core Entities

- `TelegramConfig`: Persisted bot/session pairing state
- `PendingTelegramTurn`: Queue-domain prompt turn state for queued and active Telegram-originated work
- `TelegramPreviewRuntimeState`: Preview-domain streaming state for drafts or editable Telegram messages
- `TelegramModelMenuState`: Shared inline application-menu state for status, model, thinking, and queue menu messages
- `QueuedAttachment`: Outbound files staged for delivery through `telegram_attach`

## 5. Architectural Decisions

## 5.1 Flat Domain DAG Shape

- The project follows a `Flat Domain DAG`: cohesive bridge domains live as flat `/lib/*.ts` modules, and local imports must form a directed acyclic graph
- `index.ts` stays the single extension entrypoint and composition root for live π/Telegram ports, SDK adapters, and session state
- Reusable runtime logic should be split into flat domain files under `/lib`
- Opening source-module comments must include `Zones:` tags such as `telegram`, `pi agent`, `tui`, or `shared utils`; these tags replace folder nesting as the quick responsibility map for flat Domain DAG files
- Prefer domain-oriented grouping over atomizing every helper into its own file
- Use `shared` sparingly and only for types or constants that genuinely span multiple bridge domains

## 5.2 Session And Queue Semantics

- The bridge is session-local, paired to one allowed Telegram user, and owns a local queue aligned with π lifecycle hooks
- The Telegram lock owns only external control/polling. Local extension state and queue runtime are per Pi instance: losing `/telegram-connect` ownership stops live Telegram control here, but must not clear, silence, or stop active/queued preview, final delivery, or dispatch in this instance
- Queue admission is explicit and validated: immediate commands, control lane, priority lane, and default lane must preserve allowed kind/lane pairings
- Dispatch is gated by active turns, pending dispatch, unsettled control work, compaction, `ctx.isIdle()`, and π pending messages; dispatched prompts remain queued until `agent_start` consumes them
- Telegram `/compact` owns a native `typing` keepalive for the compaction window so phone clients show activity between the started/completed notices; stop it on both completion and failure
- `/stop`, `/abort`, `/next`, and `/continue` have distinct contracts: reset queue and abort; abort while preserving queue; force next queued turn; enqueue a control-lane `continue` resume prompt without folding queued prompts into history
- Abort-history mode is scoped to Telegram-owned active turns. Internally this is `foldQueuedPromptsIntoHistory`: local/non-Telegram agent starts after abort clear it so the next Telegram prompt appends to the local queue instead of absorbing older queued turns as history
- `/start`, `/help`, and `/status` open the unified command-help/status-row/control menu; `/model`, `/thinking`, and `/queue` jump to sections directly; visible bot commands are `/start`, `/compact`, `/next`, `/continue`, `/abort`, `/stop`
- Command/menu emoji are fixed UI adornments owned by the `commands` map; do not add a persisted emoji toggle or Settings menu until there is a real setting to own
- Telegram `reply_to_message` context is prompt-only and must not affect slash-command parsing; when Telegram includes `rich_message` blocks on a quoted rich reply, extract plain text from those blocks before falling back to raw `text`/`caption` so prompt context does not leak raw Rich Markdown source
- Long-lived timers, pollers, watchers, and deferred queue dispatch must be session-bound and avoid stale live π contexts after session replacement
- Do not add Telegram commands that imitate Pi interactive session replacement, navigation, or TUI rendering through private internals, ANSI terminal clearing, raw TTY injection, or a shadow `pi` subprocess. Features such as a real Telegram `/new` require a public Pi API that runs the same session-replacement path as the terminal command.
- In-flight `/model` switching is limited to Telegram-owned active turns; if a tool call is active, abort is delayed until the tool finishes

## 5.3 Telegram Delivery Semantics

- Assistant and guest replies use Telegram-native Rich Markdown via Rich Message APIs, not Markdown→HTML conversion. Bridge-owned UI surfaces such as commands, menus, status, queue controls, and sections should keep explicit Telegram HTML/plain rendering by default because readability and maintainability are higher there. Companion sections may explicitly choose Markdown, HTML, or plain text per view. Keep native Rich Markdown source close to model-authored Markdown, but normalize Bot-API-fragile equivalents when evidence shows a Telegram parser/client edge, such as space-after-marker blockquotes (`> quote` -> `>quote`) and dollar-prefixed ticker atoms (`$BLDR` -> `\$BLDR`) outside code fences/spans
- Use `docs/telegram-bot-api-rich-messages.md` as the local Bot API/Rich Messages reference for native Rich Markdown work
- Formula guidance belongs in the Telegram-turn prompt contract: use `$...$` for inline math and `$$...$$` for block math; backticks intentionally render formulas as literal code
- Real code blocks must stay literal and escaped
- `telegram_attach` is the canonical outbound file-delivery path for Telegram-originated requests; outside active Telegram turns it may send immediately to the paired/default chat for explicit local/TUI delivery requests only when this π instance owns `/telegram-connect`. `telegram_message` is the first-class direct Telegram Markdown text tool for local/TUI prompts and is also gated by `/telegram-connect`; neither direct tool replaces normal active-turn replies. It reuses top-level `telegram_button` comments for inline buttons; buttons must be attached to a text message, never sent as standalone actions
- Telegram delivery strips top-level HTML comments from preview/final text; column-zero top-level `<!-- telegram_voice ... -->` and `<!-- telegram_button ... -->` blocks are special outbound comments handled after `agent_end` without requiring agent-side transport tool calls, while comments inside code, quotes, lists, or indented examples stay literal
- Telegram prompt guidance is layered: unconfigured sessions receive no bridge suffix, local/TUI prompts receive only explicit direct-delivery guidance, and Telegram-originated turns receive the full inbound/phone-width/output-action contract
- `telegram_voice` and `telegram_button` are not π tools; keep prompts/docs explicit that agents should author markup while voice synthesis provider extensions own TTS/OGG conversion, and pi-telegram owns button routing plus Telegram delivery
- Voice reply policy and prompt context are owned by pi-telegram's `telegram.json` `voice.replyMode`: missing/invalid config behaves as `manual` but does not add a `[voice]` prompt-context block; only an explicit valid `voice.replyMode` renders context. Render a single voice field as `[voice] reply mode: manual|mirror|always`, and render multiple fields as a `[voice]` list; place voice context after `[outputs]` when handler output exists, otherwise after `[attachments]`; provider prompt contributions are optional provider-specific additions, not the default policy channel
- Optional `telegram.json` `time` may add `[time] YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss <timezone>` to Telegram-originated prompts for wall-clock context. It is hidden by default, uses `time.injectionMode` values `hidden|always|interval`, stores `time.interval` in milliseconds, uses the system timezone, and should render last after `[attachments]`, `[outputs]`, and `[voice]` sections. The Settings row `🕒 Time injection: hidden|always|interval` controls `time.injectionMode` only.
- Voice reply mode Settings UI standard: the top-level Settings row is `👄 Voice reply: hidden|manual|mirror|always`; `hidden` is the true default and means no valid `voice.replyMode` is persisted, behavior is manual, and no voice policy is added to prompt context; explicit `manual` behaves the same operationally but renders reply-mode context. The submenu title is `👄 Voice reply mode:`; choice buttons use lowercase labels with a model-style active dot (`🟢 hidden`, `🟢 mirror`) rather than per-mode emoji; the explanatory submenu body uses compact HTML-code bullets such as `<code>-</code> <code>hidden</code> (default): ...`. Preserve this wording/icons unless the operator explicitly asks to redesign it
- Outbound voice delivery is one fallback pipeline: configured `outboundHandlers` with `type: "voice"` run first in `telegram.json` order, then programmatic voice handlers, then registered voice synthesis providers as zero-config progressive fallbacks; provider extensions must not override operator-configured handlers
- `telegram_voice` text is arbitrary TTS-target text: use body form for multiline text, `<!-- telegram_voice text="Short summary" -->` for explicit one-line text, or `<!-- telegram_voice: Short summary -->` for one-line text with no attributes
- `telegram_button` has three canonical forms: `<!-- telegram_button: OK -->` for label-only buttons, `<!-- telegram_button label=Continue prompt="Continue with the current plan." -->` for one-line prompts, or `<!-- telegram_button label="Show risks"\nList the main risks first.\n-->` for multiline prompts. Do not author JSON button specs, inline-after-text comments, standalone button tools, or comments inside code/quotes/lists/indented examples; write normal Markdown plus top-level hidden comments, and add visible parent text when buttons would otherwise be the only output

## 6. Engineering Conventions

## 6.1 Validation Hotspots

- Treat queue handling, compaction interaction, and lifecycle-hook state transitions as regression-prone areas; validate them after changing dispatch logic
- Route important runtime failures through the recent runtime event recorder so `/telegram-status` remains useful for post-mortem debugging, not just transient status-bar errors
- Treat remaining Markdown-to-HTML rendering as Telegram UI/compat output work, not generic Markdown rendering or assistant reply delivery
- Preserve literal code content in Telegram rendering
- Avoid HTML chunk splits that break tags
- Prefer width-efficient monospace table and list formatting for narrow clients, with table padding based on grapheme/display width rather than raw UTF-16 length where possible
- Flatten nested Markdown quotes into indented single-blockquote output because Telegram does not render nested blockquotes reliably

## 6.2 File And Naming Style

- Keep comments and user-facing docs in English unless the surrounding file already follows another convention
- Each project `.ts` file should start with a short multi-line responsibility header comment that explains the file boundary to future maintainers; source-module headers must include `Zones:` tags for cross-cutting responsibility areas
- Name extracted `/lib` modules and mirrored `/tests` suites by bare domain when the repository already supplies the Telegram scope; prefer `queue.ts`, `updates.ts`, and `queue.test.ts` over redundant `telegram-*` filename prefixes. Exception: the concrete Bot API transport domain is named `telegram-api.ts` / `telegram-api.test.ts` to avoid ambiguity with the public `/api/*.ts` package membranes
- Keep test helpers with the mirrored domain suite by default because test files mirror module-domain boundaries; introduce shared `tests/fixtures` only when multiple domain suites truly reuse the same setup
- Prefer targeted edits, keeping `index.ts` as the orchestration layer and moving reusable logic into flat `/lib` domain modules when a subsystem becomes large enough to earn extraction
- Keep composition wiring DRY with small local adapters or owning-domain contracts when repetition appears, but do not hide live mutable session state behind broad facades just to reduce repeated closures
- Keep interface contracts consistent for the same runtime entity: prefer the owning domain's exported contract when multiple modules mean the same entity, and use local structural `*Like`/view contracts only for deliberate narrow projections that avoid real coupling without duplicating source-of-truth shapes

## 6.3 Current Domain Ownership Snapshot

The canonical detailed ownership map lives in [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md). Keep this section as a compact agent-facing index, not a second copy of the full map.

- Scheduling and lifecycle: `queue`, `runtime`, `lifecycle`, `locks`
- Multi-bot transport and routing: `polling-manager`, `bot-connections`, `multi-bot-runtime`, `session-router`, `offline-queue`, `offline-queue-lock`
- Telegram transport and inbound flow: `api`, `polling`, `updates`, `routing`, `media`, `turns`, `inbound`, `config`, `setup`
- Response surfaces: `preview`, `replies`, `rendering`, `keyboard`, `outbound-markup`, `outbound-attachments`, `outbound`, `voice`, `status`
- Controls and application menu UI: `commands`, `menu`, `menu-model`, `menu-thinking`, `menu-status`, `menu-queue`, `model`, `prompts`
- Extension platform: `sections` owns section registry, token mapping, callback dispatch, context building, and its globalThis bridge; `voice` owns the voice-provider registry and its globalThis bridge
- Pi SDK boundary: `pi` owns direct pi imports and bound extension API ports; `bindings` owns pi-facing command/tool/lifecycle registration wiring extracted from the entrypoint

## 6.4 Entrypoint And Import Boundaries

- Keep the preview domain as a thin streaming lifecycle controller only: draft ids, safe-prefix selection for `sendRichMessageDraft`, voice suppression, serialized flushes, diagnostics, and finalization state. Do not reintroduce assistant preview rendering there; keep `rendering.ts` scoped to bridge-owned UI/compat regular-message rendering rather than assistant or guest Markdown delivery. Drafts must only send structurally closed Markdown prefixes; draft failures are not proof that drafts are globally unsupported, so record the failure and skip that preview frame. Do not add raw plain-message fallback previews for assistant Markdown
- Preview/final delivery ordering is release-critical: finalization must wait for active preview flushes, persisted final delivery should not be followed by a post-final draft-clear call that creates transient draft UI, and regressions should cover in-flight draft flush serialization plus final reply ordering
- Live Rich Draft observation: `sendMessageDraft(..., undefined)` after a persisted final Rich Message can appear in Telegram clients as a separate animated three-dot draft block before dissolving. Do not use post-final draft-clear for assistant finalization; let the persisted final `sendRichMessage` replace/complete the user-visible lifecycle and reset local preview state only.
- `RichBlockThinking` / `<tg-thinking>` is draft-only (`sendRichMessageDraft`) and may be useful for a future explicit pre-token preloader, but it is not a persisted final-message primitive and should not be mixed into release-critical finalization behavior without separate UX tests.
- Keep Telegram prompt guidance compact and operational. Do not add format-specific steering for native Rich Markdown features unless the model needs a real bridge-specific rule such as formula delimiters or hidden outbound action syntax.
- Keep direct `node:*` file-operation dependencies out of `index.ts` when an owning domain exists; the entrypoint should compose ports while domains own local filesystem details such as temp-dir preparation, attachment stats, and turn image reads
- In `index.ts`, prefer namespace imports for local bridge domains so orchestration reads as domain-scoped calls such as `Queue.*`, `Turns.*`, and `Rendering.*` instead of long flat import lists
- Keep the local `index.ts` plus `/lib/*.ts` import graph acyclic; `tests/invariants.test.ts` guards this boundary plus shared-bucket bans, empty interface-extension shell regressions, pi SDK centralization, source-only entrypoint Node-runtime/local-adapter/process/direct-pi access avoidance, runtime-domain isolation, structural leaf-domain import isolation, menu/model boundary drift, Telegram API/config default coupling, structural update/media coupling to Telegram API transport shapes, and attachment coupling to queue/inbound media/Telegram API helpers as domains keep evolving
- Do not reintroduce shared bucket domains such as `lib/constants.ts`, `lib/types.ts`, `lib/globals.ts`, or broad global-augmentation files; constants, registry keys, state interfaces, and concrete transport shapes should stay in their owning domains, and `index.ts` should not grow new shared magic constants
- Keep remaining `index.ts` code focused on cross-domain adapter wiring that needs live extension state, pi callbacks, Telegram API ports, or status updates; do not extract one-off closures solely to reduce line count
- Domain-specific queue planning, preview transport/controller behavior, UI/compat rendering, Telegram API transport, menu state, and command behavior should stay in their owning domains instead of moving to `/lib/runtime.ts` solely to shrink `index.ts`
- Prefer narrow structural runtime ports in domains that only store or route pi-compatible values; direct pi SDK/model imports should stay centralized in `/lib/pi.ts`, while domains that actively register pi hooks/tools/commands should consume those concrete contracts through the adapter

## 7. Operational Conventions

- When Telegram-visible behavior changes, sync `README.md` and the relevant `/docs` entry in the same pass
- When durable runtime constraints or repeat bug patterns emerge, record them here instead of burying them in changelog prose
- When fork identity changes, keep `README.md`, package metadata, and docs aligned so the published package does not point back at stale upstream coordinates
- README positioning should emphasize `/start` as the primary Telegram operator menu and keep reaction shortcuts secondary. Reactions are useful queue affordances, but menu controls are the core CLI-to-Telegram bridge.
- Document configuration knobs without UI in the root README when they affect bootstrap, networking, transport limits, or prompt context; currently this includes token env bootstrap, Node env proxy mode, inbound/outbound size limits, and `time`.
- Keep extension-local standards self-contained: shared patterns such as command templates may evolve independently in multiple extensions, but pi-telegram docs/changelog should describe the standard without naming sibling extension implementations as dependencies or authorities.
- Work only inside this repository during development tasks; updating the installed Pi extension checkout is a separate manual operator step, not part of normal in-repo implementation work

## 8. Integration Protocols

- Telegram API methods currently used include polling, message editing, draft streaming, callback queries, reactions, file download, and media upload endpoints
- π integration depends on lifecycle hooks such as `before_agent_start`, `agent_start`, `message_start`, `message_update`, and `agent_end`
- `ctx.ui.input()` provides placeholder text rather than an editable prefilled value; when a real default must appear already filled in, prefer `ctx.ui.editor()`
- For `/telegram-setup`, prefer the locally saved bot token over environment variables on repeat setup runs; env vars are the bootstrap path when no local token exists, and persisted `telegram.json` writes must remain atomic plus private because status/setup/polling paths may read it concurrently
- Command help plus prompt-template commands and status/model/thinking/queue controls are driven through `/start`'s Telegram inline application menu and callback queries; the Queue button shows the queued-item count, model-menu scope/pagination controls stay at the top under Main menu, the model pagination indicator opens a compact page picker, and thinking-menu text stays a compact heading because the current level is marked by button state; `/status`, `/model`, `/thinking`, and `/queue` are hidden compatibility shortcuts
- Shared inline-keyboard structure belongs to `keyboard`; application-control button labels, callback data, and callback behavior stay in `menu`/`menu-model`/`menu-thinking`/`menu-status`/`menu-queue` while core queue mechanics stay in `queue`
- Telegram `/settings` options should open nested detail submenus by default: boolean options show a description plus Back, `on`, and `off`; list options show Back plus selectable values. One-shot actions such as syncing may run directly without a submenu when there is no meaningful choice or description step.
- Inline UI labels and dialogs follow [`docs/ui-style.md`](./docs/ui-style.md): action buttons use emoji plus capitalized action text, state & navigation buttons show state and lead to a submenu, first-level submenus start with `⬆️ Main menu` while deeper submenus start with `⬆️ Back`, boolean toggles use Capitalized horizontal `On`/`Off` with green active `On`, yellow active `Off`, and black inactive dots, tabs use capitalized labels with purple default-state and yellow elevated-state active dots and black inactive dots, vertical option lists mark only the current value green, and confirmation dialogs use a single bold text-only question with emoji on buttons only.
- Inbound text/media may be transformed through configured `inboundHandlers` before queueing; legacy `attachmentHandlers` are deprecated compatibility aliases appended after `inboundHandlers`; active-turn outbound files must flow through `telegram_attach`, while explicit local/TUI Telegram sends use `telegram_attach` for files or `telegram_message` for text/buttons
- Long Telegram text split recovery belongs to `text-groups`: keep it conservative, short-debounced, same chat/user/message-id contiguous, and gated by near-limit human text so normal rapid follow-ups and slash commands stay separate
- Public API boundaries live in [`docs/public-api.md`](./docs/public-api.md): companion extensions must use public API domain subpaths such as `@llblab/pi-telegram/sections`, `/voice`, `/inbound`, `/outbound`, and `/updates`; `0.12.0` intentionally removes the published `@llblab/pi-telegram/lib/*.ts` compatibility wildcard
- Public handler API matrix: low-level buses use `registerTelegramUpdateHandler(handler)`, `registerTelegramInboundHandler(kind, handler)`, and `registerTelegramOutboundHandler(kind, handler)` without ids; high-level surfaces use stable identity (`registerTelegramSection({ id, ... })`, `registerTelegramVoiceTranscriptionProvider(provider, { id })`, and `registerTelegramVoiceSynthesisProvider(provider, { id })`). Inbound handlers and command-backed outbound handlers use command templates as the standard config contract; built-in outbound buttons use inline keyboards plus callback routing because no polling command execution is needed
- Telegram prompt-template commands are discovered from π slash commands with `source: "prompt"`; π template names are mapped to Bot API-compatible aliases (`fix-tests` → `/fix_tests`), aliases that conflict with built-in bridge commands or hidden shortcuts are not displayed, prompt-template aliases stay out of the Telegram bot command menu, and the bridge expands template files before queueing because extension-originated `sendUserMessage()` bypasses π's interactive template expansion
- Unknown callback data not owned by pi-telegram prefixes (`compact:`, `tgbtn:`, `menu:`, `model:`, `thinking:`, `status:`, `queue:`, `section:`, `settings:`) may be forwarded as `[callback] <data>` after built-in handlers decline it; update-handler extensions should follow `docs/callback-namespaces.md` and must not poll the same bot independently
- Command templates stay compact and shell-free: no `command` field, no shell execution, inline defaults are allowed as `{name=default}`, `template` may be a string or an ordered composition array, only `args`/`defaults` inherit into leaves, top-level `timeout` wraps composed sequences, stdout pipes to the next step's stdin by default, and multi-step work should use `template: [...]` rather than provider-specific fields; `pipe` is only a legacy local alias
- Command-template documentation examples should use portable executable placeholders such as `/path/to/stt` and `/path/to/tts`, not host-local skill paths or machine-specific install locations
- Abstract pi-telegram docs and README examples must not leak real companion-extension identities into generic provider ids, runtime-event categories, or sample code. Use neutral ids such as `@scope/voice-provider/tts` and reserve real companion names for explicit companion-extension lists or case-study references.

## 9. Extension Sections Conventions

- `Section identity`: use the same identity-key rules as the Extension Locks Standard (`package.json/name` → canonical id); no separate `owner` field
- `Token mapping`: Telegram's 64-byte `callback_data` limit forces compact numeric tokens (`section:0:action:payload`). Section authors never hand-roll `section:` strings — use `ctx.callbackData(action, payload?)`
- `Navigation hierarchy`: Back buttons are auto-prepended by `ctx.edit()` only. Root views use `⬆️ Main menu` → `menu:back`. Nested views from `handleCallback` use `⬆️ Back` → `section:<token>:open`. Settings views use `⬆️ Back` → `settings:list`. `ctx.open()` sends standalone chat messages without auto-navigation
- `Context ports`: sections receive `TelegramSectionContext` / `TelegramSectionCallbackContext` with `answerCallback`, `edit`, `open`, `enqueuePrompt`, and `callbackData`. Section views default to `parseMode: "html"`; use explicit `"markdown"` when a section naturally owns Markdown content, or `"plain"` for text. No filesystem access, no raw bot clients, no second polling loop
- `Settings indicators`: use `settings.getLabel()` for dynamic status rows in the Settings submenu (e.g., `🟢`/`⚫️` based on internal state). Called on every Settings list render
- `Handler fallback`: `section.handleCallback` runs first; if it returns `"pass"` and `settings.handleCallback` exists, the settings handler runs with a fresh context carrying `backCallback="settings:list"`
- `Stale tokens`: unknown or unregistered tokens answer the callback with a short popup. Section errors are caught and surfaced as popup text — no unhandled exceptions leak to polling
- `Load order`: `pi-telegram` must load first (sets `globalThis.__piTelegramSectionRegistry__`). Consumer extensions load second. The typed import is the preferred path; the `globalThis` bridge exists for load-order tolerance
- `Shutdown`: call `pi.on("shutdown", () => unregister())` in the extension's default export
- `Section separators`: extension-injected main-menu rows appear before the **⚙️ Settings** row. Extension settings rows appear before built-in Proactive push controls
- `Model button format`: use `provider/ModelId` format (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`) across model menu buttons and status row. The compact `provider/id` form is canonical
- `Section domain ownership`: `lib/sections.ts` owns the registry, token mapping, callback dispatch, and context building. `lib/menu.ts` dispatches `section:` callbacks before built-in handling. `lib/menu-status.ts` injects section rows. `lib/menu-settings.ts` injects settings rows and passes `sectionRegistry` through callback deps
- `Callback routing order`: button actions → compact confirmations → queue menu → settings menu → section callbacks → built-in menu handling → `[callback]` fallback. Settings menu callbacks always pass `sectionRegistry` to `updateTelegramSettingsMenuMessage` and `handleTelegramSettingsMenuCallbackAction`

## 9. Pre-Task Preparation Protocol

- Read `README.md` for current user-facing behavior and fork positioning
- Read `BACKLOG.md` before changing runtime behavior or documentation so open work stays truthful
- Read `/docs/architecture.md` before restructuring queue, preview, rendering, or command-handling logic
- Inspect the relevant `index.ts` section before editing because most bridge behavior is stateful and cross-linked

## 10. Task Completion Protocol

- Run the smallest meaningful validation for the touched area; `npm test` is the default regression suite once rendering or queue logic changes
- For rendering changes, ensure regressions still cover nested lists, code blocks, underscore-heavy text, and long-message chunking
- For queue/dispatch changes, validate abort, compaction, pending-dispatch, and π pending-message guard behavior
- Sync `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, and `/docs` whenever user-visible behavior or real open-work state changes
