**Telegram runtime adapter for Pi.**

`pi-telegram` turns a private Telegram DM into a session-local operator console for Pi. It admits work, preserves context, streams readable replies, keeps busy sessions usable through queues, lets other extensions share one bot, and turns assistant-authored intent into native Telegram artifacts. It is also a voice-provider platform: companion extensions can supply Telegram transcription and synthesis providers while `pi-telegram` keeps ownership of transport, queueing, and reply policy.

The product shape is a mobile companion for a live Pi session: start work in the terminal, then continue from Telegram on the couch or outside. It is not a remote terminal, PTY supervisor, or process launcher, and it intentionally avoids pretending to own Pi's interactive TUI.

This repository is an actively maintained fork of [`badlogic/pi-telegram`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-telegram). It started from upstream commit [`cb34008`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-telegram/commit/cb34008460b6c1ca036d92322f69d87f626be0fc) and has since diverged substantially.

## How to read this README

This README is the product hyperindex for `pi-telegram`: a compact representation of the extension from several lenses, not a dump of every implementation detail.

- **Operator companion**: continue and supervise a live Pi session from Telegram without turning Telegram into a fake terminal.
- **Telegram UI harness**: menus, settings, queue controls, native typing/activity, Rich Markdown replies, drafts, buttons, voice, files, and artifacts become Telegram-shaped affordances around Pi.
- **Runtime adapter**: Telegram turns map into Pi lifecycle, queueing, model switching, compaction, previews, active/final replies, and ownership rules.
- **Threaded organism**: optional multi-instance mode lets one leader and visible follower Pi processes share one bot through named Telegram Threads.
- **Companion-extension platform**: stable APIs let other extensions add sections, commands, status rows, update handlers, voice providers, and outbound/inbound behavior without owning polling.
- **Safety boundary**: the bridge exposes a safe mobile companion subset, not arbitrary TUI/session control, hidden process launch, or raw terminal command dispatch.
- **Release map**: this file points to focused docs for the deeper contracts; `BACKLOG.md` tracks open release work and `CHANGELOG.md` records completed behavior.

Use this README to understand the extension's shape and values first, then follow the focused docs for exact contracts.

## Install

From npm:

```bash
pi install npm:@llblab/pi-telegram
```

From git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/llblab/pi-telegram
```

## Connect

### 1. Create a Telegram bot

1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Run `/newbot`
3. Pick a name and username
4. Copy the bot token

### 2. Configure the bot token in Pi

Start Pi, then run:

```bash
/telegram-setup
```

Paste your bot token when prompted. If a bot token is already saved in `~/.pi/agent/telegram.json`, the setup prompt shows that stored value by default. Otherwise it prefills from the first configured environment variable in `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, or `TELEGRAM_KEY`. The saved config file is written atomically with private `0600` permissions.

### 3. Connect this Pi session

```bash
/telegram-connect
```

The adapter is session-local: only one Pi instance polls Telegram at a time. In classic mode, `/telegram-connect` records external control/polling ownership in `~/.pi/agent/locks.json`. In multi-instance bus mode, `/telegram-connect` joins the local Telegram organism: the first live instance becomes leader, later live instances register as followers instead of taking over while the leader heartbeat is healthy. Local queue and reply state stay per Pi instance, so an instance that loses Telegram control still finishes work it already accepted.

### 4. Pair your Telegram account

1. Open the DM with your bot in Telegram
2. Send `/start`

The first user to message the bot becomes the exclusive owner of the adapter. Messages from other users are ignored.

### Environment-only configuration

Most day-to-day controls live in the Telegram menu or Pi commands. A few important runtime knobs intentionally stay in environment variables because they affect bootstrap, networking, or transport limits before a menu can help:

- **Bot token bootstrap**: `/telegram-setup` can prefill from `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, or `TELEGRAM_KEY` when no token is already saved.
- **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**: native `fetch` can use `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` when Node's environment proxy mode is enabled. Use `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` or start Node with `--use-env-proxy`. SOCKS5 is not part of the zero-dependency core. If you need it, run a local HTTP-to-SOCKS bridge or system tunnel and point `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` at the HTTP endpoint.
- **Telegram network family**: `PI_TELEGRAM_NETWORK_FAMILY=auto|ipv4|ipv6|ipv4-fallback` controls Bot API transport only. The default is `ipv4-fallback`: try native `fetch` first, then retry transport-level failures through IPv4-only HTTPS. Use `auto` to force native `fetch` only, or `ipv4`/`ipv6` to force a family.
- **Agent data root / temp location**: `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` changes the base agent directory used for `telegram.json`, locks, generated outbound-handler artifacts, and Telegram temp files. When unset, the adapter uses `~/.pi/agent`, so inbound Telegram files land in `~/.pi/agent/tmp/telegram`.
- **Inbound file limit**: `PI_TELEGRAM_INBOUND_FILE_MAX_BYTES` or `TELEGRAM_MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` changes the default 50 MiB Telegram download limit.
- **Outbound attachment limit**: `PI_TELEGRAM_OUTBOUND_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` or `TELEGRAM_MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE_BYTES` changes the default 50 MiB `telegram_attach` delivery limit.

Assistant Markdown is delivered through Telegram's native Rich Message API. There is no `telegram.json` rendering toggle: final replies use `sendRichMessage`, and streaming previews use `sendRichMessageDraft` when Telegram drafts are available.

Long-running Telegram turns use Telegram's native active status as the activity indicator: technically Bot API `sendChatAction(typing)`, presented in product language as `...active` even when Telegram clients render it as typing dots. The bridge does not expose an activity verbosity setting; active status is the only automatic in-chat work signal before the final reply.

Set these variables before launching Pi. Some transport defaults (notably Telegram temp directory and inbound/outbound byte-limit constants) are intentionally captured when the extension modules load, while setup-token defaults and agent-dir lookups used by config/locks are read through their runtime helpers.

## Use

Once paired, chat with your bot in Telegram. Text, images, files, replies, edits, media groups, and configured handler output are forwarded into Pi as Telegram-originated turns.

What it feels like:

- Start work in the terminal, walk away, and keep supervising the same live Pi session from Telegram.
- Open `/start` and get a Telegram control panel for the running Pi session: status, prompt templates, model, thinking, settings, and queue.
- Fire off three tasks while Pi is busy. They become visible queue items instead of terminal noise.
- Open Queue from the menu, inspect waiting work, delete stale prompts, or move important work forward.
- Switch models from Telegram mid-run; the adapter schedules a safe continuation instead of tearing state apart.
- Send a voice note; a configured inbound handler or registered STT provider transcribes it; Pi answers in the same chat.
- Drop a screenshot and ask, "what is broken here?" The image payload reaches Pi with the local file context.
- Ask for a generated file; when Pi calls `telegram_attach`, the artifact returns with the active Telegram reply or is sent directly to the paired/default chat from local work.

### Telegram controls

Use these inside the Telegram DM with your bot. The main entrypoint is `/start`: it opens the operator menu and exposes many of the important agent controls that can be safely adapted through Pi's extension APIs. The bot does not forward arbitrary terminal slash commands or emulate TUI-only session controls.

- **`/start`**: Pair the first Telegram user when needed, register bot commands, and open the inline application menu with command help, prompt-template commands, status rows, model controls, thinking controls, settings, and queue controls.
- **`/compact`**: Ask for inline confirmation, then start session compaction when the session is idle; Telegram shows the native active indicator while manual or automatic compaction is running.
- **`/next`**: Dispatch the next queued turn, aborting Pi first if needed.
- **`/continue`**: Enqueue a priority `continue` prompt.
- **`/abort`**: Abort the active run without touching the queue. Abort-history applies only to Telegram-owned active turns; later local prompts do not make the next Telegram prompt absorb older queue items.
- **`/stop`**: Abort the active run and clear waiting Telegram queue items.

Hidden compatibility shortcuts: `/help` and `/status` open the main application menu, `/model` opens model controls, `/thinking` opens reasoning controls, `/queue` opens queue controls, and `/settings` opens bridge settings.

Prompt-template commands are discovered from Pi prompt templates, mapped to Telegram-safe aliases (`fix-tests.md` becomes `/fix_tests`), shown in `/start`, and expanded before queueing.

### Pi commands

Run these inside Pi, not Telegram:

- **`/telegram-setup`**: Configure or update the Telegram bot token.
- **`/telegram-connect`**: Start polling Telegram updates in the current Pi session and acquire the singleton lock.
- **`/telegram-disconnect`**: Stop polling in the current Pi session and release the singleton lock.
- **`/telegram-status`**: Inspect adapter status, connection, polling, execution, queue, and recent redacted runtime/API failure events.

### Files and artifacts

Send files or images directly to the bot. Inbound downloads are saved under `<agent-dir>/tmp/telegram` and default to a 50 MiB limit. The agent dir is `~/.pi/agent` unless `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` overrides it.

If you ask Pi for a generated file, Pi can call `telegram_attach`: during a Telegram-originated turn the adapter sends it with the next Telegram reply, and during local/TUI work it sends directly to the paired/default chat, a registered follower's assigned thread, or explicit `chat_id` plus optional `thread_id`. Local work can also use `telegram_message` when you explicitly ask the agent to push a Markdown text message to Telegram; embedded `telegram_button` comments are parsed and attached to that message. Direct local/TUI delivery requires the current Pi instance to own `/telegram-connect`, or to be registered with an explicitly enabled multi-instance bus so it can route through the leader; if neither is true, take over or enable/register with the bus before sending. Outbound attachments default to a 50 MiB limit. Environment variables for both limits are listed in [Environment-only configuration](#environment-only-configuration).

### Experimental multi-instance bus

Classic private-chat behavior is the default. To experiment with multiple live Pi instances sharing one bot token, opt in explicitly in `telegram.json`:

```json
{
  "bus": { "mode": "multi-instance" }
}
```

Only the leader calls `getUpdates`; registered followers authenticate to the local bus with a leader-minted capability secret and route allowlisted, target-scoped Telegram work through the leader. BotFather private-chat threads are the preferred UI targets: the leader provisions its own thread, and user-started follower processes receive fresh visible threads only after explicit `/telegram-connect` registration unless the same live binding identity already has a live binding; newly created follower threads receive a baked 4-6 letter thread name from the assigned slot's curated palette plus a short connected notice so Telegram clients surface the tab. If a live leader later prunes a follower after missed heartbeats, it sends an `Instance <name> disconnected` notice in that follower's thread before cleanup, using the thread name when available and the slot letter as the fallback, so stale tabs are recognizable. Telegram never launches hidden Pi follower processes: to add another instance, start Pi in a terminal and run `/telegram-connect` there. If all threads were closed, the first new owner-created thread is reclaimed for the leader and served locally; later unknown owner-created threads are treated as accidental unbound tabs, the original prompt is preserved, and the bridge offers a target-thread chooser instead of launching hidden processes. Fresh thread names are assigned by the bridge, not by an agent prompt: the bridge picks one of five curated 4-6 letter names for the slot letter and stores it as the instance thread name; existing human-named threads are preserved. Group/thread input is still authorized by `allowedUserId`, and live Telegram smoke testing is still the stability gate for Bot API topic transport, rich drafts, reactions, and chat actions.

## Core features

### Operator menu and controls

The inline application menu is the primary operator surface. It exposes status, prompt-template commands, companion-extension Telegram commands, model selection, thinking level selection, settings, and queue inspection/mutation: a Telegram-shaped subset of the important handles normally available from the CLI. A typical control loop stays inside Telegram: open `/start`, inspect status, jump into Queue, delete stale work, switch model, return to the main menu, and keep the Pi session running without touching the terminal.

### Queue runtime

Messages sent while Pi is busy enter the prompt queue and are processed in order. Control actions and model-switch continuation turns use higher-priority lanes. Queue processing and reply delivery stay local to the Pi instance that accepted the work, even if `/telegram-connect` later moves elsewhere.

The menu is the primary way to inspect and mutate the queue. Reactions are an extra shortcut when Telegram delivers `message_reaction` updates for the chat. The same rules apply to text, voice, files, images, and media groups:

- Priority shortcuts: `👍`, `⚡️`, `❤️`, `🕊`, and `🔥` promote waiting work.
- Removal shortcuts: `👎`, `👻`, `💔`, `💩`, and `🗑` remove waiting work from the queue.

### Streaming and native Rich Markdown

Assistant Markdown is sent to Telegram as native Rich Markdown. Streaming previews use Telegram rich-message drafts when a structurally closed Markdown prefix is available, and final replies persist the complete Markdown through `sendRichMessage`. The bridge still strips top-level hidden action comments before delivery and splits only when Telegram transport limits require it.

Telegram HTML rendering remains the default for bridge-owned UI surfaces such as commands, menus, status messages, queue controls, and extension sections, where explicit markup is clearer and easier to maintain. Native Rich Markdown is reserved for model-authored Markdown replies and guest replies that naturally arrive as Markdown.

### Media, replies, edits, and split text

Telegram replies to earlier text or caption messages are forwarded as `[reply]` context for normal prompts, while slash commands still parse from the new message text only. If a Telegram message is edited while still waiting in the queue, the queued turn is updated instead of duplicated. Very long text messages that Telegram appears to split automatically are coalesced through a conservative debounce when the first chunk is near Telegram's text limit.

### Inbound handlers and STT providers

`telegram.json` can define ordered `inboundHandlers` for Telegram → Pi preprocessing: text translation, voice transcription, OCR, PDF extraction, or any command-template pipeline. Matching handlers run before the turn enters the queue; failed handlers record diagnostics and fall back safely. Legacy `attachmentHandlers` still work as a deprecated compatibility alias appended after `inboundHandlers`.

A practical voice setup is simple: Telegram `.ogg` arrives, STT runs locally or through your chosen command, stdout is injected as `[outputs]`, and Pi receives the result as usable prompt context. Extensions can also register programmatic inbound handlers; full voice extensions can register transcription providers. Explicit `inboundHandlers` and legacy `attachmentHandlers` run first, then programmatic inbound handlers, then registered STT providers as fallback for voice/audio files.

```json
{
  "inboundHandlers": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "template": "/path/to/translate --lang {lang=en} --text \"{text}\""
    },
    {
      "type": "voice",
      "template": [
        "/path/to/stt --file {file} --lang {lang=ru}",
        "/path/to/translate-stdin --lang {lang=en}"
      ]
    },
    {
      "mime": "audio/*",
      "template": [
        "/path/to/stt-fallback --file {file} --lang {lang=ru}",
        "/path/to/translate-stdin --lang {lang=en}"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Outbound handlers, voice synthesis providers, and buttons

Assistant replies can include hidden outbound blocks. `telegram_voice` and `telegram_button` are not Pi tools; they are assistant-authored HTML comments that the adapter removes from Telegram text and handles after `agent_end`. Recognized blocks must start at column zero on a top-level line outside fenced code, quotes, lists, and indented examples. Do not use JSON button specs, inline comments after visible text, or standalone button tool calls; write normal Markdown plus hidden comments, and add visible parent text if buttons would otherwise be the only output.

Prompt guidance is context-aware: unconfigured sessions receive no Telegram suffix, local/TUI prompts only get explicit direct-delivery guidance, and Telegram-originated turns get the full phone-width output and action-comment contract.

```md
Full technical answer stays readable as text.

<!-- telegram_voice lang=ru rate=+30%
Text to synthesize as a Telegram voice message.
-->

<!-- telegram_button label="Show risks"
List the main risks first.
-->
```

Outbound `type: "text"` handlers can transform final text/Markdown before native Rich Markdown delivery. Voice output can be handled either by configured `outboundHandlers` with `type: "voice"` or by registered voice synthesis provider extensions: the bridge extracts `telegram_voice` text or intercepts text by reply mode, asks the voice pipeline for a `.ogg`/`.opus` artifact, and uploads it through Telegram `sendVoice`. Explicit configured voice handlers run before zero-config providers, so operator-owned `telegram.json` pipelines stay authoritative.

The agent writes intent; providers or voice handlers own TTS and format conversion, the adapter owns Telegram transport, and buttons route back as queued prompts.

### Voice reply policies

The bridge can automatically convert agent text replies into Telegram voice messages without requiring explicit `<!-- telegram_voice -->` markup in every response. Configure this from Settings → `👄 Voice reply` or by setting `voice.replyMode` in `telegram.json`:

- `hidden` (default): no `voice.replyMode` is stored. Behavior is manual, but prompt context stays silent.
- `manual`: agent-authored `<!-- telegram_voice -->` markup is required for voice replies; no automatic conversion. Unlike `hidden`, this explicit mode adds `[voice] reply mode: manual` context.
- `mirror`: when the user sends a voice message, the next reply is converted to voice and text preview is suppressed. Text-originated turns stay on the normal/manual text path, so agent-authored `<!-- telegram_voice -->` markup still works explicitly.
- `always`: every reply is converted to voice and text preview is suppressed.

If `telegram.json` explicitly sets a valid `voice.replyMode`, prompts include compact `[voice] reply mode: ...` context after handler outputs. When the field is missing or invalid, behavior still defaults to manual/hidden and the prompt context stays silent.

In `mirror` and `always` modes, the bridge transparently intercepts agent text responses and routes them through the outbound voice pipeline. Configured `outboundHandlers` with `type: "voice"` run first in their configured order; zero-config registered synthesis providers run after them as progressive fallbacks. If several synthesis providers are installed, they are tried in registration order and the first one that returns a valid `.ogg`/`.opus` artifact handles the reply; `undefined`, errors, or invalid output fall through to the next provider. If every voice generator fails, the bridge falls back to sending the text reply instead.

Voice synthesis provider extensions register TTS backends at runtime through public API domain subpaths. Multiple synthesis providers can be registered; stable provider registrations pass a durable abstract id owned by the companion extension, such as `"@scope/voice-provider/tts"`. The bridge tries configured `type: "voice"` handlers first, then programmatic handlers, then registered synthesis providers in registration order until one succeeds. Providers and handlers receive the text to synthesize and optional `lang`/`rate` hints from `<!-- telegram_voice -->` markup or the automatic interception path. Voice delivery must produce `.ogg` or `.opus` files.

Provider code examples, transcript-caption behavior, and diagnostics patterns live in [Voice Integration](./docs/voice.md) and [Public API](./docs/public-api.md). The important boundary is: providers own TTS and any private optimization, while pi-telegram owns reply policy, prompt context, fallback ordering, and Telegram transport.

### Extension interop

Unknown inline-button callbacks are forwarded to Pi as `[callback] <data>` when they do not belong to pi-telegram, so other extensions can namespace and handle Telegram buttons without polling the bot themselves. Layered extensions that need synchronous update handling can register a handler on the shared update registry.

### Extension Sections

Ordinary pi extensions can register Telegram-native slash commands, structured UI sections, and compact status lines without owning a second polling loop. Slash commands use explicit opt-in registration from `@llblab/pi-telegram/commands`, so workflow-specific commands can live in companion extensions instead of expanding the core bridge command set. UI sections appear in the main Telegram menu and Settings submenu, default to explicit Telegram HTML UI markup, and may explicitly choose Markdown or plain text when that better matches their content; status lines allow widgets such as quota indicators to appear beside Status, Usage, Cost, and Context only when relevant to the active model. Each section gets a narrow typed context with `edit`, `open`, `enqueuePrompt`, `answerCallback`, and `callbackData()` — enough to build interactive Telegram-native surfaces while `pi-telegram` owns transport, callback routing, navigation hierarchy, and diagnostics.

Import `registerTelegramSection()` from `@llblab/pi-telegram/sections` and return a disposer on shutdown. Sections can send interactive messages directly into the chat via `ctx.open()` — confirmation dialogs, approve/deny gates, and multi-step forms live outside the menu hierarchy while callbacks route through the same typed handler. See [`@llblab/pi-telegram-extension-demo`](https://github.com/llblab/pi-telegram-extension-demo) for a working reference and the [Extension Sections Standard](./docs/sections.md) for the full contract.

### Proactive push

`telegram.json` can set `proactivePush: true` to send successful local non-Telegram final replies to Telegram when no Telegram turn is active and this Pi instance currently owns `/telegram-connect` or is registered as a Threaded Mode follower. Non-owners skip proactive delivery instead of pushing unrelated local/headless results through a bot they no longer control. Local prompt text is not mirrored because the bot does not own terminal user messages. The mode is off by default and can be toggled from settings.

### Time context

`telegram.json` can opt into a compact `[time]` line in Telegram-originated prompts so Pi has a wall-clock reference for requests such as "today", "now", or scheduling. It is hidden by default and uses the system timezone; the mode can also be changed from Settings → `🕒 Time injection`.

```json
{
  "time": {
    "injectionMode": "interval",
    "interval": 3600000
  }
}
```

Modes are `hidden`, `always`, and `interval`. `hidden` means no time line is added to prompt context. `interval` is measured in milliseconds and rate-limits the time line per chat in memory, so back-to-back messages do not repeatedly spend context on the same timestamp. When present, `[time]` is the final prompt-context section after attachments, handler outputs, and voice policy.

## Notes

- The extension intentionally keeps rich visual/TUI configuration minimal for now. For advanced setup, ask an agent to read this README and the docs, then update `~/.pi/agent/telegram.json` for your workflow.
- Replies to Telegram prompts are sent as Telegram replies to the source message when possible; if the source message is unavailable, delivery falls back to a normal message.
- Temporary inbound Telegram files are cleaned up on later session starts.

## Companion Extensions

Third-party extensions that integrate with `pi-telegram`:

- [`pi-codex-usage`](https://github.com/llblab/pi-codex-usage) — Compact Codex subscription quota/status widget for the Pi statusline and the inline menu status text opened by `/start`.

```bash
pi install npm:@llblab/pi-codex-usage
```

- [`pi-telegram-tool-status`](https://github.com/Timur00Kh/pi-telegram-tool-status) — Live-updating service messages that list tools used by the agent. It keeps one message per Telegram prompt and edits it in place as tools execute.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-telegram-tool-status
```

- [`pi-xai-voice`](https://github.com/luxus/pi-xai-voice) — Companion extension that adds xAI-powered TTS for voice reply policies and `telegram_voice` markup.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-xai-voice
```
